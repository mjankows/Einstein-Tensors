# Einstein Tensors
 A Python program which uses sympy to calculate the Christoffel symbols, the Riemann, Ricci, and Einstein Tensors, and the Ricci Scalar for a given spacetime metric. This version is very primitive, and only solves for a hard-coded metric. Later versions will have functionality for calculating these expressions for any user-inputted metric.
